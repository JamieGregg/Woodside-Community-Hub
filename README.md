# Woodside-Community-Hub
A2 CCEA SSD Coursework 2019 for Woodside Community Hub. A booking/admin system for the management of the new Woodside Community Center.

## Technologies Used
This was my big project using multiple technologies together with the integration of a Database. 
1. C#
2. Microsoft SQL Server

## Key Takeaways
This was a great introduction to programming on a larger system. The major takeaway from this project for me was the structure and importance of organisation in a large codebase. As the project increased in size I did not keep on top of file organisation, this became a problem during the testing stage.
